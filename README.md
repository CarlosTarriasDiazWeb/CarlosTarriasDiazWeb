## About me 👨‍💻
Hi I am Carlos and I am passionate about web technologies. I am currently studying a higher degree in web development in Barcelona.  
This portfolio showcases a collection of the web projects and user interfaces I've developed in the last two years.  

You will find samples of my experience in various areas, such as developing responsive websites, creating functional user interfaces, and implementing interactive features with Javascript and Vue.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and get a glimpse of my work. Thank you for visiting!
